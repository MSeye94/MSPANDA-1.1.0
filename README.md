# MSPANDA-1.1.0
MS-PANDA is an untargeted omics data analysis tool.
It makes it possible to build a set of reference peptides or metabolites,
detected by CE/MS or LC/MS, from the analysis samples of a given biological liquid (plasma, urine, etc.).
This reference set is then used to match and normalize peptides or metabolites from a new sample.
It makes it possible to compare protein expression between different conditions,
to look for possible biomarkers associated with a pathology, a condition, a treatment
 
## The MS-PANDA tool consists of two parts:
1. New reference map: allows the development of a new peptide or metabolite reference map of a given biological liquid.
This reference map is then used to identify a set of intensity-stable particles.
2. Analysis new sample: a second part that allows to detect, match and normalize the peptides or metabolites of a new sample on the reference map.
